Before following the steps of this guide, you must know the risks of jailbreaking. Every time you modify you device, while rare, you risk permanently damaging your console. We are not responsible for any damage done to your device.

+  You may be vulnerable to more malware and other security issues after jailbreaking compared to if you were in a non+ jailbroken state.
